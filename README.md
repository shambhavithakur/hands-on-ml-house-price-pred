# Predicting House Prices

## Training and fine-tuning a regression model

This project is about training a machine-learning model to predict median house prices in small districts of the United States (US). It features the use of a Scikit-learn pipeline to apply data transformations in one&nbsp;step.

### Project objectives

1. Explore data.

2. Preprocess the data.

3. Choose a model.

4. Train the model.

5. Fine-tune the model.
